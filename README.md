# HeterophilousDatasets


This repo contains datasets and code to reproduce evaluation of baseline models on datasets from [A critical look at evaluation of GNNs under heterophily: Are we really making progress?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tJbbQfw-5wv) paper.

All the datasets are in *data* folder.
To reproduce the evaluation of a model, run *train.py* with the desired set of parameters
To reproduce the evaluation of heterophily-specific models, please, refer another [another repo](https://github.com/heterophily-submit/HeterophilySpecificModels).
